# SH∆FIQ ∆IM∆N

Hey there!

Let me introduce myself first. My name is [Shafiq Aiman](https://twitter.com/\_shafiqaiman\_). This gitbook is where I keep all of my notes regarding pentest. These notes were collected through my [write-up](https://shafiqaiman.com) on capture the flag challenges.

This note is far from perfect in terms of organization. I'll try my best to organize it. Anyways, enjoy!
